// does depend on `bb`, and `::bb` really is the crate rather than the local
// module, since `a/src/bb.rs` defines no `Thing`.
//
// `a/sub` is here because ranking by depth decides two orderings, not one:
// root against member, and shallow member against the one nested inside it. A
// first cut of this fixture pinned only the first, and answering "0 for the
// root, 1 for everything else" kept it green while `a` governed `a/sub` — where
// `use cc::Deep;` is E0432, `cc` being declared by `sub` alone.
